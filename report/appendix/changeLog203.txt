Objective Caml 2.03:
--------------------

New ports:
- Ported to BeOS / Intel x86 (bytecode and native-code).
- BSD / Intel x86 port now supports both a.out and ELF binary formats.
- Added support for {Net,Open}BSD / Alpha.
- Revamped Rhapsody port, now works on MacOS X server.

Syntax:
- Warning for "(*)" and "*)" outside comment.
- Removed "#line LINENO", too ambiguous with a method invocation;
  the equivalent "# LINENO" is still supported.

Typing:
- When an incomplete pattern-matching is detected, report also a 
  value or value template that is not covered by the cases of 
  the pattern-matching.
- Several bugs in class type matching and in type error reporting fixed.
- Added an option -rectypes to support general recursive types,
  not just those involving object types.

Bytecode compiler:
- Minor cleanups in the bytecode emitter.
- Do not remove "let x = y" bindings in -g mode; makes it easier to
  debug the code.

Native-code compiler:
- Fixed bug in grouping of allocations performed in the same basic block.
- Fixed bug in constant propagation involving expressions containing
  side-effects.
- Fixed incorrect code generation for "for" loops whose upper bound is
  a reference assigned inside the loop.
- MIPS code generator: work around a bug in the IRIX 6 assembler.

Toplevel:
- Fixed incorrect redirection of standard formatter to stderr
  while executing toplevel scripts.

Standard library:
- Added List.rev_map, List.rev_map2.
- Documentation of List functions now says which functions are
  tail-rec, and how much stack space is needed for non-tailrec functions.
- Wrong type for Printf.bprintf fixed.
- Fixed weird behavior of Printf.sprintf and Printf.bprintf in case of
  partial applications.
- Added Random.self_init, which initializes the PRNG from the system date.
- Sort.array: serious bugs fixed.
- Stream.count: fixed incorrect behavior with ocamlopt.

Run-time system and external interface:
- Fixed weird behavior of signal handlers w.r.t. signal masks and exceptions
  raised from the signal handler.
- Fixed bug in the callback*_exn() functions.

Debugger:
- Fixed wrong printing of float record fields and elements of float arrays.
- Supports identifiers starting with '_'.

Profiler:
- Handles .mli files, so ocamlcp can be used to replace ocamlc (e.g. in a
  makefile).
- Now works on programs that use stream expressions and stream parsers.

Other libraries:
- Graphics: under X11, treat all mouse buttons equally; fixed problem
  with current font reverting to the default font when the graphics
  window is resized.
- Str: fixed reentrancy bugs in Str.replace and Str.full_split.
- Bytecode threads: set standard I/O descriptors to non-blocking mode.
- OS threads: revised implementation of Thread.wait_signal.
- All threads: added Event.wrap_abort, Event.choose [].
- Unix.localtime, Unix.gmtime: check for errors.
- Unix.create_process: now supports arbitrary redirections of std descriptors.
- Added Unix.open_process_full.
- Implemented Unix.chmod under Windows.
- Big_int.square_big_int now gives the proper sign to its result.

Others:
- ocamldep: don't stop at first error, skip to next file.
- Emacs mode: updated with Garrigue and Zimmerman's snapshot of 1999/10/18.
- configure script: added -prefix option.
- Windows toplevel application: fixed problem with graphics library
  not loading properly.
